For this assignment, you will need to fork this respotiory (see the upper-right corner of this page).
Once you have your own fork, clone it like you would with any other repository. Edit 
`hw03.c` to return the correct values, and then commit and push your changes to your fork.

Details about the implementations of the functions in `hw03.c` are in the comments.

Example input commands and their corresponding expected outputs are show in `example_input.sh` and `example_output.txt` respectively.
